#Challenge 1 - Vending Machine

(Extract taken from Code Institute Tutorials)

Change the function so that instead of a list of coins, the function works with a dictionary that contains the coin denominations, and the quantity of each coin available. By default, assume there are 20 of each coin, but this can be overridden by passing a dictionary to the function as with the previous example.

If a coin that would normally be used to make change isn't available the program should attempt to use smaller coins to make up the change.

If it is not possible to make the change with the coins available, the function should raise an error.
